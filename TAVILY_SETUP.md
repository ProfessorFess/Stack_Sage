# Tavily Web Search Integration

## Overview

Stack Sage now includes **web search capabilities** via Tavily to answer meta-game questions, tournament data, and deck popularity that aren't available in static rules or card databases.

## What Can It Do?

The `search_mtg_meta` tool enables the agent to answer questions like:

‚úÖ "What decks are popular in Modern right now?"  
‚úÖ "What won the last Pro Tour?"  
‚úÖ "Is Dockside Extortionist seeing play in cEDH?"  
‚úÖ "What's the current Standard meta?"  
‚úÖ "Is Orcish Bowmasters banned anywhere?"  
‚úÖ "Best budget Commander deck 2024"  

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get a Tavily API Key (Free!)

1. Go to [https://tavily.com](https://tavily.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Get your API key from the dashboard
4. Free tier includes 1,000 searches/month

### 2. Add to Your .env File

Add the following line to your `.env` file:

```bash
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install tavily-python
```

Or reinstall from requirements:

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

## How It Works

### Agent Decision Making

The agent automatically decides when to use web search:

**Question**: "What decks are popular in Modern?"  
‚Üí Agent thinks: *"This is about current meta, not rules"*  
‚Üí Uses `search_mtg_meta` tool  
‚Üí Returns current tournament data and deck trends

**Question**: "How does the stack work?"  
‚Üí Agent thinks: *"This is a rules question"*  
‚Üí Uses `search_rules` tool  
‚Üí Returns Comprehensive Rules sections

### Tool Features

- **MTG-Focused**: Automatically adds "Magic the Gathering MTG" to queries
- **Advanced Search**: Uses Tavily's "advanced" depth for thorough results
- **AI Summary**: Gets Tavily's AI-generated answer summary
- **Source Citations**: Includes URLs and snippets from top results
- **Smart Limits**: Configurable max results (default: 5)

## Example Usage

### Via CLI

```bash
python stack_sage.py
```

Then ask:
```
üÉè Your question: What decks won the most recent Pro Tour?
```

The agent will:
1. Recognize this needs current tournament data
2. Use `search_mtg_meta("recent Pro Tour winner decklist")`
3. Return results with sources

### Programmatically

```python
from backend.core.tools import search_mtg_meta

# Direct tool usage
result = search_mtg_meta.invoke({
    "query": "Modern meta tier list 2024",
    "max_results": 5
})
print(result)
```

## What Gets Searched?

Tavily indexes:
- MTG tournament sites (StarCityGames, TCGPlayer, etc.)
- Reddit MTG communities
- MTG strategy articles and blogs
- Official WotC announcements
- Pro player content
- Deck database sites

## Tool Behavior

### When API Key is Missing

```
‚ùå Tavily API key not configured. 

To use web search, add your Tavily API key to the .env file:
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

Get a free API key at: https://tavily.com
```

The agent can still function using other tools - web search is **optional**.

### When Package Not Installed

```
‚ùå Error: tavily-python package not installed. 
Run: pip install tavily-python
```

## Response Format

## Integration with Other Tools

Agent workflow:
1. `check_format_legality("Orcish Bowmasters", "modern")` ‚úì Legal
2. `search_mtg_meta("Orcish Bowmasters Modern play rate")` ‚Üí Popular, tier 1
3. `lookup_card("Orcish Bowmasters")` ‚Üí Get card details
4. Synthesize complete answer
